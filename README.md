# AI Echo: Intelligent Sentiment Detection Engine for ChatGPT Reviews

[cite\_start]This project analyzes user reviews of a ChatGPT application, classifying them as positive, neutral, or negative to gain insights into customer satisfaction and enhance the user experience[cite: 5, 6]. [cite\_start]It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in text[cite: 4].

## üéØ Business Use Cases

The insights from this sentiment analysis can be applied to several business areas:

  * [cite\_start]**Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understand customer opinions to improve product features[cite: 8].
  * [cite\_start]**Brand Reputation Management**: Monitor user sentiment to assess the overall brand perception over time[cite: 9].
  * [cite\_start]**Feature Enhancement**: Identify areas for improvement based on negative and neutral reviews[cite: 14].
  * [cite\_start]**Automated Customer Support**: Prioritize customer complaints based on their sentiment[cite: 15].
  * [cite\_start]**Marketing Strategy Optimization**: Develop better engagement strategies based on sentiment insights[cite: 16].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

This project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

  * [cite\_start]**Technologies**: Python, NLP, Machine Learning, Deep Learning[cite: 52].
  * [cite\_start]**Libraries**: Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn[cite: 53].
  * [cite\_start]**Deployment**: Streamlit, AWS (optional)[cite: 54].

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

[cite\_start]The project uses the `chatgpt_reviews` dataset[cite: 56], which includes the following features:

  * [cite\_start]`date`: The submission date of the review[cite: 61].
  * [cite\_start]`title`: A short headline for the review[cite: 63].
  * [cite\_start]`review`: The full text feedback from the user[cite: 65].
  * [cite\_start]`rating`: A numerical score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent)[cite: 67, 68, 69, 70].
  * [cite\_start]`platform`: The platform where ChatGPT was accessed, such as "Web" or "Mobile"[cite: 80, 81].
  * [cite\_start]`version`: The version of ChatGPT being reviewed (e.g., "3.5", "4.0")[cite: 91, 92].
  * [cite\_start]`verified_purchase`: Indicates if the reviewer was a paying subscriber[cite: 93].

## üìà Project Approach

The project follows a structured 5-step approach:

1.  [cite\_start]**Data Preprocessing**: The text data is cleaned and normalized by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters, and by performing stemming or lemmatization[cite: 25].
2.  [cite\_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Trends in sentiment distribution are identified, and word frequencies are visualized using word clouds and histograms[cite: 28, 29].
3.  [cite\_start]**Sentiment Classification Model**: Text is converted into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF or BERT embeddings[cite: 31, 32]. [cite\_start]Models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTMs, or Transformers are trained for classification[cite: 33, 34].
4.  [cite\_start]**Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the AUC-ROC curve[cite: 36].
5.  [cite\_start]**Deployment & Visualization**: A web-based dashboard is deployed using Streamlit or Flask to visualize sentiment trends[cite: 38].

## üìä Project Deliverables

  * [cite\_start]Cleaned & Preprocessed Dataset [cite: 98]
  * [cite\_start]EDA Report with Visualizations [cite: 99]
  * [cite\_start]Trained Machine Learning/DL Model for Sentiment Analysis [cite: 100]
  * [cite\_start]Web Dashboard for Sentiment Insights [cite: 101]
  * [cite\_start]Model Performance Report & Insights Document [cite: 102]
